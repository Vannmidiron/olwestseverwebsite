<h1>Starting off</h1>
<br>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>Rules are very important and can be found <a href="https://www.flipbookpdf.net/web/site/827694acec0b8f97afe4d28ef1f373b8ae3e1a64FBP23531839.pdf.html
    "> here</a></p>
<h3>Name and backstory</h3>
<p>Like with any RGP you need a name for your character please remember we are a streamer friendly sever. Also come up with a backstory. it doesn't need to be a novel but something that your gives something to the way you play your character.</p>
<br>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p> Name Joshua Bear, Age 25 years old. Josh came from a town out west where his family used to own a bar. It however got burnt down and he lost his family. He couldn't bare to live with the reminders of his family. So he is looking to try his hand at something new within this county.<p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Creating your look</h3>
<p>We have a character selection process where you can add scars, change hair length and colour. You can also change the height and weight of your character also.</p>
<br>
<p>The only bad thing is that you start off in your skivies. so it is off to the clothing store with you which can be seen on your map as a tshirt logo.</p>
